# MLR_Ttests

Scripts:

MLR_izumo1_juno.R: Multiple linear regression used to evaluate the statistical relationships between sex and genotype on predicting litter size.  

t-test.R: T-tests used to determine the significance of differences in litter size between genotypes. Student’s or Welch’s t-tests were used, depending on differences in variance within each genotype group as Welch’s t-test provides a more robust method for dealing with unequal variances, characteristic of our small dataset.
